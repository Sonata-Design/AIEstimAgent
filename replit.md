# Project Architecture Summary

## Overview

This is a full-stack construction takeoff application that allows users to upload building blueprints and automatically extract material quantities using AI. The app provides a web interface for managing construction projects, viewing drawings, and generating detailed takeoff reports for cost estimation.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **React SPA**: Built with React and TypeScript using Vite as the build tool
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components with Radix UI primitives and Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Routing**: wouter for client-side routing
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming

### Backend Architecture
- **Node.js/Express**: RESTful API server with TypeScript
- **Development Server**: Vite middleware integration for development
- **File Upload**: Multer for handling PDF and image uploads (up to 50MB)
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM for persistent data storage

### Database Design
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon Database serverless hosting
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL with proper relations
- **Schema**: Well-defined tables for projects, drawings, takeoffs, and material costs
- **Relations**: Explicit foreign key relationships between tables
- **Migrations**: Managed through Drizzle Kit (`npm run db:push`)

## Key Components

### Core Entities
1. **Projects**: Construction projects with basic metadata
2. **Drawings**: Uploaded blueprint files (PDF, PNG, JPG) with processing status
3. **Takeoffs**: Extracted material quantities from drawings
4. **Material Costs**: Cost database for different construction materials

### Frontend Components
- **Dashboard**: Main application interface with project overview
- **Project Sidebar**: Project and drawing navigation
- **Drawing Viewer**: Interactive blueprint display with zoom/pan capabilities
- **Takeoff Panel**: Material quantity results and cost calculations
- **Upload Zone**: Drag-and-drop file upload with validation

### API Endpoints
- `/api/projects` - Project CRUD operations
- `/api/projects/:id/drawings` - Drawing management
- `/api/drawings/:id/takeoffs` - Takeoff data
- `/api/material-costs` - Cost database access

## Data Flow

1. **Project Creation**: Users create construction projects
2. **Drawing Upload**: Blueprint files uploaded and stored
3. **AI Processing**: (Placeholder) Drawings processed to extract elements
4. **Takeoff Generation**: Material quantities calculated and stored
5. **Cost Calculation**: Quantities multiplied by material costs for estimates

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Libraries
- React ecosystem (React, ReactDOM)
- TanStack Query for data fetching
- Radix UI for accessible components
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- date-fns for date manipulation

### Backend Libraries
- Express.js web framework
- Drizzle ORM and Drizzle Kit
- Multer for file uploads
- Neon Database serverless PostgreSQL driver

### Development Tools
- Vite for build tooling and development server
- TypeScript for type safety
- ESBuild for production builds

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
- Frontend: Vite builds React app to `dist/public`
- Backend: ESBuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
- Single artifact deployment with static file serving

### Environment Configuration
- PostgreSQL database via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- Neon Database for serverless PostgreSQL hosting
- File uploads stored in local `uploads` directory

### Production Considerations
- Express serves built React app in production
- Database migrations handled through Drizzle Kit
- File storage currently local (scalability consideration)

### Recent Changes (August 2025)
- **Database Integration**: Successfully migrated from in-memory storage to PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Navigation System**: Implemented functional navigation between Dashboard, Projects, and Reports pages
- **Project Detail Pages**: Added individual project view/edit functionality with comprehensive project management
- **Persistent Storage**: All project data, drawings, takeoffs, and material costs now persist in the database
- **Settings Page**: Added comprehensive settings interface for user preferences, notifications, AI configuration, and security
- **Sample Data**: Automatic initialization of sample construction data on first run
- **Calculator Tool Removal**: Removed the calculator widget from the navigation header to improve UI spacing
- **Takeoff Type Selection**: Added comprehensive takeoff type selector allowing users to choose specific building elements (doors, windows, flooring, walls, electrical, plumbing, HVAC, structural) for AI analysis
- **Selective AI Analysis**: Implemented backend API for running takeoff analysis on specific element types rather than all elements at once
- **Centered Navigation**: Moved main navigation items (Dashboard - Projects - Reports) to center of header for better visual balance
- **Prominent AI Takeoff Button**: Added bright purple "Run AI Takeoff" button in dashboard toolbar for clear user workflow
- **Enhanced Project Management**: Added "Create Project" buttons to both dashboard and projects pages for easier project creation
- **Improved User Experience**: Clear visual hierarchy with separated project info section and drawing tools section in dashboard
- **Streamlined Interface**: Removed header notifications and user profile elements for cleaner design
- **Vertical Takeoff Selector**: Replaced left sidebar with vertical takeoff element selector and settings button
- **AI Chat Widget**: Added floating AI assistant widget in top-right corner for construction questions
- **Real-time Analysis Panel**: Replaced right panel with live progress tracking and detailed takeoff results
- **Automatic File Processing**: Files now automatically process and start AI analysis when dropped in the floor plan area
- **Default Element Selection**: System auto-selects common takeoff types (doors, windows, flooring, electrical) for immediate analysis
- **Project Navigation Fix**: Resolved project detail navigation by making entire project cards clickable with proper event handling
- **Comprehensive Project Detail Page**: Completed tabbed interface with Overview, Takeoffs, Drawings, and Saved Analyses sections
- **Data Manipulation Features**: Added inline takeoff editing, analysis saving/deleting, CSV export, and cost calculations
- **Database Schema Completion**: Successfully migrated all tables including savedAnalyses, takeoffs, and materialCosts with proper relations
- **Project Deletion Fix**: Resolved critical bug where DELETE API responses (204 No Content) caused JSON parsing errors in frontend; implemented proper empty response handling

### Current Limitations
- Local file storage (not suitable for distributed deployment)
- AI processing logic not implemented (placeholder functions)
- No authentication/authorization system

The architecture now provides persistent data storage with PostgreSQL while maintaining clear separation of concerns and preparation for production deployment (cloud storage, actual AI integration).
